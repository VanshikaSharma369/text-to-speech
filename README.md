Technology Used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

ABOUT:
This project is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage (text.html) provides a user interface where users can enter text into a textarea and click a play button to hear the text spoken aloud. The functionality is powered by JavaScript (script.js), which utilizes the Web Speech API to convert text into speech. When the button is clicked, the speak() function retrieves the entered text, checks if it's empty, and then creates a SpeechSynthesisUtterance instance to generate speech. If the text area is empty, an error message is displayed. The project can be enhanced by adding features such as pause, stop, voice selection, and speed control. While the title suggests a Speech-to-Text Converter, the current implementation actually performs Text-to-Speech conversion, meaning it reads out the text entered by the user.
